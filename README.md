# machine-learning

This repository aims to implement and explain basic concepts of machine learning.  
This repository is a work in progress and not claiming to be complete.  
The README in each folder will explain how each specific algorithm works.  
The actual implementation will be in c and a Makefile provided to create the
executable.

Please note that the programs and implementations are by no means highly
optimized and are not expected to perform at the level of the best machine learning
libraries.

Please also note that all graphing is/will be done by gnuplot and all users should abide
by their license when modifying/distributing this code.
