# Machine Learning

This repository aims to implement and explain basic concepts of machine learning.  

    Currently this repository has these explanations and recommends reading in this order:
    1. Linear Regression (located in regression/linear)
    2. Matrices and Machine Learning (located in matrices)

The README.md in each folder will explain how each concept works.  
The actual implementation is done in c and comes with a Makefile.  
The visualization is thanks to the great program gnuplot.  

This repository is a work in progress and may have spelling mistakes (sorry :P)  
Also know that nothing here is as highly optimized as the hard working people
  that maintain machine-learning libraries and you probably would want to use
  their implementations or modify this to be faster and more portable.

Also since we use gnuplot you must be careful and follow their Copywrite when using and
especially if modifying this repository.
